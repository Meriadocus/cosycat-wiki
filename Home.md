# **Welcome to the Cosycat wiki!**

**Cosycat** is an web-based application allowing users to query a corpus database using a regex-based query syntax, filter results for a variety of variables, view the results of said query in a query pane, and subsequently annotate results intuitively in a separate annotation pane, saving annotations to the database tied to the hit for later retrieval. It also allows for collaborative working within teams and supervision of work from project leaders; multiple users can operate on the same projects with various levels of access and alteration to be set by the project’s creator. Cosycat is designed with an emphasis on modularity and reusability.

# **About the creators: Mind-Bending Grammars**

Mind-Bending Grammars is EU-funded project innovatively combines language change research with research on the individual mind. In the past linguistics has often treated change as happening to an abstract object ‘language’. But it is the minds of actual people that change language. Mind-Bending Grammars will contribute to our understanding of the adaptive powers of adult cognition. The project specifically aims at making a breakthrough in two key issues in linguistic theory by tracing with the utmost detail step-by-step changes in grammatical constructions:
1.	How much innovation is possible in the adult cognitive system? Where does change halt only to be continued by a next generation?
2.	Are changes in adult cognition one-off events or are they connected? How strong do connections need to be before structures start coevolving as a group?
These aims are to be achieved through the use of Cosycat in conjunction with the EMMA corpus.
