# **Projects**

* Projects are required for the querying and annotation of data through the app and can be used to access the other functions of the application more generally. They are created through the user homepage once logged in.

 ## **Project Creation**

* The New Project button allows the user to navigate to the project creation page.

* *(Image to be added)*

* This page prompts the user to enter a (beautiful) name for their project as well as a description to indicate to other users its purview and purpose. Examples of existing project names and descriptions are:
  1. *ProgressiveConstruction, Covers the analysis of the progressive construction as well as the progressive forms of the [go to INF]-    future. The non-progressive forms of the [go to INF]-future are covered separately.*
  2. *YeovTheov, The wondrous world of English people and their second person pronouns. Of great interest to anyone attempting to imitate ye olde Englishe today.*
  3. *SubjectToSubjectRaising, Case study subject-to-subject raising.*
  
 * Once complete the project can be viewed on the homepage and the project page itself allows access to the functions of the project including query, event tracking and issue reporting as well as exhibiting the users in the project.
  
  ## **Project Configuration**
  
  * Projects are vital for controlling and allowing the collaborative work environments that are one of the primary aims of the application. They are a method of allowing for control over the manner and level of dialogue within a given project, separating projects with distinct aims and focuses, and allowing for queries, annotations, issues, events and settings to be separated similarly. 

  ### **Users**
  
  *	Users can be added to a project from this page using the corresponding ‘Add User’ button. This prompts the user to search for a username or email (etc) to add to the project. An autocomplete/dropdown function is operational in this window allowing for the easy searching of users on the application.
  
  *	Once selected the user’s profile is displayed showing their username, name, email address, and join/last active dates. It also allows the project creator to select the access level of this new user. To do this, scroll through the options (guest, user, and project-lead) select the username in the text box below, press enter/return and approve the user access level once the appropriate selection has been made.
  
  * The user will then appear on the homepage with their information visible alongside that of the other users in the project. The creator can edit their role within the project from this screen by using the edit button on the right of the role and following the user access selection procedure detailed previously.
  
  * The user access roles vary in the levels to which they can influence the project in the following ways: 
  1.Guests can read annotations and suggest changes but nothing more; 
  2.Users can read annotations, suggest changes, insert annotations and edit their own annotations; 
  3. Project-lead is in charge of the global research goals and is able to edit everyone’s annotations. 
  4. The Project Creator access level cannot be assigned to new users and is, logically, only assigned to the creator themselves. Project Creators have unlimited access within their projects.
  
  *	Projects can be left by any users and deleted by the project creator.
  
  ### **Settings**
    
  * Projects have various features and settings that separate them and menus for accessing their individual sets of information and attributes. 
  
  * Through accessing the general settings menu (top right bar) project creators can change their global setting as well as specifying individual configurations for each project by using the two 'save' buttons: *Save for Project* and *Save Globally*.
  
  * The first tab in Settings allows a user to specify their preferred Query and Text Snippet options. The user specifes through the use of dropdowns the preferred:
  1. **window** (controls the length of the context around a hit (in words)), 
  2. **size** (controls the number of hits shown per page), 
  3. **snippet size** (allows control of the number of words retrieved around the match when viewed in text mode) and 
  4. **extra snippet text** (controls number of words added when a snippet is expanded in text mode). 
  
  * The second tab allows specification of the nature of notifications for users and projects. Users can:
  1. **get new avatar** (generate an avatar with a random seed)
  2. **set notification delay** (set a time in msec until a notification dies out)
  3. **set notification verbosity** (determine, via a number of tickboxes, what events a user will be notified of (see **Settings Key for an exhaustive list).
  
  * The third tab gives information in the corpora and their attributes.
  
  * The final tab allows users to specify tagsets for annotation autocomplete via a choice of tickboxes. These tagsets can be specified for each project, added to and customised to suit the subject matter of the project in question.
  
  * All of these settings can be saved for a project or globally over the users' profile, allowing for a user to customise their experience in Cosycat and optimise their projects to be suited to their use.
  
  ### **Project Attributes**
  
  * From the project page, users can access stored information and attributes of the project in question. 
  
  * These are exhibited on the homepage as tabs. 
  
  * In the first tab users in the project are exhibiting as described above.
  
  * The second tab shows an events history of the project, detailing when, where and by whom certain changes are made in the projects , such as new users being added or queries being saved.
  
  * The third tab details the queries saved to the project for recall and later use. It also allows a user to delete these queries from the project altogether.
  
  * The final tab exhibits any issues opened within the project, detailing their attributes and status. These issues can be sorted based on a variety of criteria in dropdown menus in the pane.
