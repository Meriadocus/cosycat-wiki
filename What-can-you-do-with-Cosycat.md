# **What You Can Do With Cosycat**

Cosycat is a browser-based application allowing users to query a corpus database using a regex-based query syntax, filter results for a variety of variables, view the results of said query in a query pane, and subsequently annotate results intuitively in a separate annotation pane, saving annotations to the database tied to the hit for later retrieval. It also allows for collaborative working within teams and supervision of work from project leaders; multiple users can operate on the same projects with various levels of access and alteration to be set by the project’s creator. While Cosycat can absolutely be used for annotating typical NLP resources (such as Part-of-Speech tagging a newspaper corpus), it is mostly geared towards (preferrably team-based) Corpus Linguistic research aimed at statistically analyzing particular constructions that have to be first retrieved and annotated.

## **Annotation**

Annotation in Cosycat utilises inline marking of items in the hits of a query, facilitating use of context, marking of a variety information types through different key: value combinations, and marking both spans and individual items. The annotations are viewed within the same pane on any particular hit encouraging comparative review and analysis. These annotations are also stored within the corpus database itself (?) which allows for various statistical or diagnostic (queries? Scripts? ?) to be conducted on the data after annotation and to assist in analysis of large-scale datasets.

## **Projects and Collaboration**

* Through the use of multiple users in single projects, collaborative work is supported and encouraged by the application and the user access levels allow the control of discussion and promote discussion of conflicts and issues flagged during the annotation and analysis. While multiple projects separate investigations with differing aims or focuses, the overarching project-lead access level and the inclusion of other users in all these projects allows cohesion across them.

* The collaboration inherent in Cosycat’s design is also intended to promote supervision of users’ work by the project lead. The issues reporting system, both for software problems and conflicting annotations, maximises the clarity of any discussions or supervision reports.
